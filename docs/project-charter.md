# Project Charter  
## Cloud-Native Telecom Analytics Platform

---

## 1. Purpose and Goal

### Primary Goal

Design, build, and operate a production-style, cloud-native analytics platform that ingests telecom-style event data, processes it in near real time, and exposes analytics via APIs and dashboards—explicitly to demonstrate modern DevOps and platform engineering competencies.

This project is intended as a **skills-retraining and portfolio artifact**, not a commercial product.

---

## 2. Target Skill Outcomes

The project is explicitly structured to demonstrate competency in:

### Core DevOps
- Docker (multi-stage builds, image optimization)
- Kubernetes (deployment, services, autoscaling, upgrades)
- CI/CD pipelines (build → test → deploy)
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
- GitOps or declarative deployment practices

### Cloud (AWS)
- EKS (or equivalent managed Kubernetes)
- IAM (least privilege, service roles)
- Managed data services (RDS, S3)
- Cost-awareness and budget controls

### Observability & Operations
- Metrics, logs, and traces
- SLO-oriented monitoring
- Alerting and failure investigation
- Basic chaos and resilience testing

### APIs & Integration
- REST APIs (OpenAPI)
- Optional gRPC for internal services
- Authentication and authorization basics

### Domain-Specific Value
- Telecom-style event modeling (CDRs, QoS, signaling-like data)
- Time-series and event-driven processing patterns

---

## 3. System Scope

### In Scope
- Event ingestion services
- Message-based or stream-based processing
- Persistent storage (relational + object)
- Analytics APIs
- Lightweight web dashboard
- Full CI/CD automation
- Kubernetes-based deployment
- AWS-hosted infrastructure

### Explicitly Out of Scope
- Real telecom network integration
- Carrier-grade performance or compliance
- Mobile apps
- Full billing or OSS/BSS implementations
- Pixel-perfect UI/UX

## 4. Architectural Principles

The system will adhere to the following principles:

1. **Cloud-Native First**  
   Stateless services where possible, externalized state, immutable builds.

2. **Operational Realism**  
   Every component must be deployable, observable, and debuggable.

3. **Automation Over Manual Processes**  
   No manual infrastructure setup after initial bootstrapping.

4. **Cost-Conscious Design**  
   Services chosen with explicit awareness of AWS costs.

5. **Incremental Complexity**  
   Start simple; evolve architecture only when justified.

---

## 5. Technology Constraints

- Primary languages: **Python** (backend), **JavaScript** (UI and tooling)
- Container runtime: **Docker**
- Orchestration: **Kubernetes**
- Cloud provider: **AWS**
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions (or equivalent)
- Infrastructure as Code: **Terraform**

Alternative technologies may be introduced **only with explicit justification**.

---

## 6. Success Criteria

This project is considered successful if:

- A new developer can deploy the entire system from scratch using documented steps
- All services run in Kubernetes
- CI/CD pipelines build and deploy automatically
- Core services emit metrics and logs
- System behavior under failure is understood and documented
- Architecture and tradeoffs can be clearly explained in an interview

---

## 7. Non-Functional Requirements

- Infrastructure must be reproducible
- Secrets must not be hardcoded
- Deployments must be idempotent
- Rollbacks must be possible
- System must tolerate single-pod failures without total outage

---

## 8. Deliverables

- GitHub organization with multiple repositories
- Architecture diagrams
- README and design documentation
- CI/CD pipelines
- Terraform modules
- Demonstration scripts (load, failure, scaling)
